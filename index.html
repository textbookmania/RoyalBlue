<p>Text Book Mania is a way computer science (ICS) students, attending at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM), can exchange their textbooks more easily and more actively. This project is developed as a direct way for ICS students to exhcange their textbook without using other web applcation such as craigslist. Services like craigslist are public service so finding a textbook another student is selling will be tedious and by the time you found that textbook, the ad was up for more than three days which could lead to another buyer to getting the book before you. With Text Book Mania you can put in a buy order of desired textbook for your ICS course and you will be given a list of other ICS student selling the textbook you desired. The process for selling a book is the same as well. Text Book Mania is a innovative way for students to get their books fast where buyers and sellers are straightforward and honest. The best thing about this application is that this service is free to all users that have an account with UHM. </p>
